# Secure-Anonymous-Chat-on-Tor-using-OnionShare-AWS
This project sets up a temporary, encrypted chat service on the darknet using OnionShare and AWS. It ensures anonymous, end-to-end encrypted communication with no logging or third-party tracking. Hosted as a Tor hidden service, it allows users to chat securely without exposing their identity.
